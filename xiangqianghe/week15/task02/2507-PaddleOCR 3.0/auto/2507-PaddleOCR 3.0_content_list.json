Its significance has never been more pronounced than in the current era of artificial intelligence, where massive volumes of unstructured visual data are generated and consumed daily across scientific, industrial, and social domains. The recent surge in large language models (LLMs)(Achiam et al., 2023; Baidu-ERNIE-Team, 2025; Guo et al., 2025; Yang et al., 2025) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems(Lewis et al., 2020) has further elevated the strategic importance of OCR: it is no longer sufficient for OCR systems to merely transcribe text accurately—they must now serve as critical enablers in the construction of high-quality datasets, facilitate knowledge extraction, and act as bridges between the visual and semantic layers of modern AI systems.

Early OCR systems(Casey and Lecolinet, 1996; Mori et al., 1999), based on hand-crafted features and rule-based heuristics, performed adequately under controlled conditions but quickly reached their limits when confronted with the complexity and diversity of real-world scenarios. The advent of deep learning, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and their derivatives, ushered in a new era of data-driven OCR, enabling substantial improvements in recognition accuracy, robustness, and adaptability(Goodfellow et al., 2014; Shi et al., 2015). However, as large-scale AI applications proliferate, new requirements have emerged: OCR engines need to handle a broader range of documents—from handwritten notes and multilingual content to rare or historical scripts, and complex layouts with tables, charts, and embedded images. Furthermore, in industrial and research settings alike, OCR is increasingly expected to support downstream tasks such as document understanding, key information extraction (KIE), and semantic search, often as part of end-to-end intelligent workflows.

These systems rely heavily on the availability of high-quality, diverse, and accurately labeled textual corpora for both pre-training and inference. OCR, in this context, is not simply a data acquisition tool, but a linchpin technology that fuels the entire pipeline—from digitizing vast archives of scientific literature to enabling real-time question answering over heterogeneous document collections. The accuracy and comprehensiveness of OCR outputs directly influence the performance and trustworthiness of LLM-based applications, especially in domains where information is predominantly shared in scanned or image-based formats (e.g., legal documents, historical records, scientific papers, and business forms). Moreover, RAG architectures, which combine retrieval mechanisms with generative modeling, are particularly sensitive to the quality of underlying document representations. Inadequate OCR can propagate errors, introduce noise, or omit critical content, thereby undermining the effectiveness of retrieval and the factual correctness of generated responses. ",

Traditional pipelines typically struggle with low-quality scans, complex backgrounds, non-standard fonts, and multi-modal documents that blend text with figures, tables, or handwritten annotations. The diversity of real-world languages, scripts, and writing styles further complicates the recognition process, requiring not only robust visual modeling but also powerful language understanding capabilities. In addition, industrial and research users increasingly demand lightweight, easily deployable solutions that can be adapted to different hardware constraints and integrated seamlessly with larger AI ecosystems. The open-source community has played a pivotal role in democratizing access to advanced OCR technology, yet there remains a gap between academic research prototypes and production-ready systems capable of supporting the stringent requirements of dataset construction, RAG workflows, and large-scale document intelligence.

Since its initial release in 2020, PaddleOCR has adhered to the principles of comprehensive coverage, end-to-end workflow, and lightweight efficiency, setting new standards for both usability and technical excellence in the OCR domain. Anchored by the PP-OCR series, PaddleOCR has evolved through multiple iterations—each pushing the boundaries of text detection, recognition, and document analysis. Early versions such as PP-OCRv1(Du et al., 2020) focused on achieving an optimal balance between accuracy and speed, making OCR accessible for resource-constrained environments. Subsequent releases (PP-OCRv2(Du et al., 2021), v3(Li et al., 2022b), and v4) incrementally improved recognition performance, extended language coverage, and introduced sophisticated models for handwriting and rare character recognition. A notable advancement has been the integration of document structural understanding via the PP-Structure series, enabling PaddleOCR to move beyond text lines and paragraphs to address complex layout analysis, table structure recognition (e.g., SLANet(Li et al., 2022a)), and other advanced parsing tasks. These capabilities have made PaddleOCR a critical engine for automated document processing, intelligent archiving, information extraction, and, increasingly, for supporting the data pipelines of LLMs and RAG systems.

Firstly, PP-OCRv5 adopts the more advanced PP-HGNetV21 as its backbone network, replacing the previous PP-HGNet. Moreover, PP-OCRv5 enhances model robustness through knowledge distillation, utilizing a visual encoder from the advanced GOTOCR2.0 (Wei et al., 2024) as the teacher model to transfer knowledge by aligning feature representations with the PP-HGNetV2 student. Finally, PP-OCRv5 detection model enhances text detection performance by incorporating advanced data augmentation techniques, including hard case mining via ERNIE-4.5-VL-424B-A47B comparison and text line-based multilingual strategies (random synthesis, rotation, blurring, geometric transformations). Notably, PP-OCRv5 detection model retains effective strategies from PP-OCRv4, such as the PFHead (Parallel Fusion Head) architecture and the DSR (Dynamic Scale-aware Refinement) training strategy. Overall, PP-OCRv5 improves the model’s ability to generalize across diverse datasets, leading to more accurate and reliable text detection in real-world scenarios. ",

During training, the GTC-NRTR branch guides the SVTRHGNet branch (Du et al., 2022), but only the lightweight SVTR-HGNet branch is used for prediction, ensuring both accuracy and speed (Li et al., 2022c). For data construction, PP-OCRv5 combines traditional models with the ERNIE-4.5-VL-424B-A47B to automatically annotate and filter high-quality handwritten samples, including rare characters generated through synthesis. Additionally, large-scale labeled data is obtained from documents like PDFs and e-books using automated parsing and edit distance filtering.
